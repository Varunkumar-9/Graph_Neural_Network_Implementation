# Graph_Neural_Network_Implementation
Associated with University of Massachusetts Lowell


- Designed and implemented Graph Neural Networks (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT) on CORA (node classification) and ENZYMES (graph classification) datasets.
- Evaluated model performance using validation accuracy to identify the most effective architecture for each classification task.
- Gained hands-on experience in graph-based deep learning techniques and their applications in structured data analysis.
- Demonstrated strong proficiency in Python and frameworks like PyTorch/Deep Graph Library (DGL).
